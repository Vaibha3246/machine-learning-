first of all we find the outliers 
how the treat ouliers     1.trimming 2.capping

trimming: trimming is a technique where we remove the outliers from the data 

it is used  when the outliers are less in the data 

but when the outliers are more in the data so we used capping 

tapping : is a technique where we handle the outlier by using the upper limit value and lower limit value 

  those value which is greter than upper limit so we replace  these value by upper limit 
  and those value which is smaller than the lower limit value so this value replace by lowerlimit
